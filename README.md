# Devoid Engine

Devoid Engine is a custom-built game engine designed as a personal learning project to better understand modern game engine architecture and rendering systems. It primarily uses OpenGL for rendering and is written in C# using OpenTK. While it is not intended for production use, it includes many modern engine features and supports editor integration.

## Installation
You need .NET 8.0 to run this project.
Currently, to work with the editor you will **require** a editor project to launch via the engine starter project.

## Usage

### Creating a GameObject

```
GameObject gameObject = this.gameObject.scene.addGameObject(); // Optionally specify a name or set gameObject.Name
```

### Adding components

```
gameObject.AddComponent<MeshRenderer>();
// or
MeshRenderer meshRenderer = new MeshRenderer();
gameObject.AddComponent(meshRenderer);
```
